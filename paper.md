# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region,
but continental scale said nahhhhh.

# Simulations
We perform simulations.

# Maethods
We compared our measurements with Smith et al 2002.

# Results
The simulations indicate these really important results.

# Figures
Figures go in this section

# Conclusions
Here are our conclusions
